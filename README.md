## **Dataset:**
This model has been trained on the [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) dataset: 

> **SQuAD2.0** combines the 100,000 questions in SQuAD1.1 with over 50,000 unanswerable questions written adversarially by crowdworkers to
> look similar to answerable ones. To do well on SQuAD2.0, systems must
> not only answer questions when possible, but also determine when no
> answer is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering.
